# GGC (Github Gist Client)

Welcome to our GitHub Gist Client website! We offer a simple and convenient way to browse and share gists on GitHub. 

Our site allows you to search for gists by username, language, or keyword, and you can view the gists in their original format.

With our site, you can easily discover new gists and share them with others.

The project can be launched with "npm start", but it needs a ".env" file that has a variable REACT_APP_GITHUB_AUTH that contains a githb API key



* as a sidenote, when listing 3 forks of a certain gist, I added a button to not spam the Github Api and risk getting banned
