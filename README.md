# GGC (Github Gist Client)

Welcome to our GitHub Gist Client website! We offer a simple and convenient way to browse gists GitHub. 

The project can be launched with "npm start", but it needs a ".env" file that has a variable REACT_APP_GITHUB_AUTH that contains a githb API key

Possible impovements:
-Color scheme
-Loading feedback when making requests


* as a sidenote, when listing 3 forks of a certain gist, I added a button to not spam the Github Api and risk getting banned
